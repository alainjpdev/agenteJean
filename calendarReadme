🔧 Workflow Name: _calendarAgentJP

Purpose:
To create an AI-powered calendar assistant that understands natural language queries (e.g., “schedule a meeting tomorrow at 10”), interacts with Google Calendar, and manages event tasks like creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving events — all integrated with a Google Sheet for contact references.

2. Main Agent: Calendar Agent
	•	Type: LangChain Tools Agent
	•	Role: Acts on AI instructions to perform calendar operations.
	•	System Prompt Includes Instructions:
	•	When to use specific tools: Create Event, Delete Event, Create Meet, etc.
	•	Spanish-based instructions to ensure proper formatting and behavior.
	•	Assumes 1-hour default duration if unspecified.
